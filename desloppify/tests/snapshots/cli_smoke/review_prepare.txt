  → query.json updated

  Holistic review prepared: 1 files in codebase

  Workflow:
    1. Read .desloppify/query.json for context, excerpts, and investigation batches
    2. For each batch: read the listed files, evaluate the batch's dimensions (batches are independent — parallelize)
    3. Cross-reference findings with the sibling_behavior and convention data
    4. For simple issues (missing import, wrong name): fix directly in code, then note as resolved
    5. For cross-cutting issues: write to findings.json (format described in system_prompt)
    6. Import: desloppify review --import findings.json
    7. Run `desloppify issues` to see the work queue, then fix each finding and resolve

  AGENT PLAN:
  1. Run each investigation batch independently (parallel-friendly)
  2. Capture findings in findings.json
  3. Import and rescan
  Next command to improve subjective scores: `desloppify review --import findings.json`

  → query.json updated. Review codebase, then: desloppify review --import findings.json
