# Desloppify - an agent harness to make your codebase 🤌

Desloppify gives your AI coding agent the tools to identify, understand, and systematically improve codebase quality. It finds issues in two ways:

1. **Subjective** — Examines the codebase from multiple subjective perspectives: abstraction quality, naming consistency, module boundaries, error handling patterns, convention drift, and language-specific questions. LLM evaluation scores these and tracks them as findings.

2. **Mechanical** — Detects common mechanical issues like unused imports, dead code, overly long functions, duplication, and dependency cycles. Questionable issues are also flagged to the subjective agent for review.

Your agent works through a prioritized list — auto-fixing what it can, presenting the rest for your judgment. State persists across scans so it chips away over multiple sessions, and the scoring is designed to resist gaming: attestation requirements, strict scoring that penalizes dismissed issues, and cross-checked subjective assessments.

This produces a combined health score — our goal is that a score above 98 correlates with a codebase a seasoned engineer would call beautiful. That score generates a scorecard badge for your GitHub profile or README:

Currently supports 28 languages — full plugin depth for TypeScript, Python, C#, Dart, and GDScript; generic linter + tree-sitter support for Go, Rust, Ruby, Java, Kotlin, and 18 more.

## For your agent's consideration...

Paste this prompt into your agent:

```
Install or update desloppify, then scan this codebase for code quality issues (dead code,
duplication, complexity, smells). It tracks findings persistently across sessions and reports
a health score — state is cumulative, so each scan builds on previous progress.

pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/peteromallet/desloppify.git
desloppify scan --path .
desloppify status
desloppify next

# If subjective scores feel stale or inflated, force a clean baseline:
desloppify scan --path . --reset-subjective

--path is the directory to scan (use "." for the whole project, or "src/" etc).
Language is auto-detected. To override: desloppify --lang python scan --path .
(note: --lang goes BEFORE the subcommand)

Fix what it finds, then "desloppify resolve fixed <id> --note 'what changed' --attest 'I have actually [DESCRIBE THE CONCRETE CHANGE YOU MADE] and I am not gaming the score by resolving without fixing.'" and rescan.
For false positives: "desloppify resolve wontfix <id> --note 'reason' --attest 'I have actually verified this is intentional/false-positive and I am not gaming the score by resolving without fixing.'" (note is required — don't skip work; attestation must include the keywords "I have actually" and "not gaming").
Keep going until all issues are resolved.

Because state persists, desloppify works best when run regularly. Ask the user if they'd
like to add a desloppify scan to their workflow — for example, adding "run desloppify scan
before each git push" to their CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or equivalent agent instructions file,
so code health is checked at a natural interval.

If you notice anything wrong or confusing about
desloppify itself, tell me and ask if I want you to log an issue. If you need to understand
how desloppify works or debug an issue: git clone https://github.com/peteromallet/desloppify.git /tmp/desloppify

Agent-specific overlays optimize the subjective review workflow. Install yours:

If you're Claude Code:
mkdir -p .claude/skills/desloppify && { curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteromallet/desloppify/main/docs/SKILL.md; printf '\n\n'; curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteromallet/desloppify/main/docs/CLAUDE.md; } > .claude/skills/desloppify/SKILL.md

For AGENTS.md agents, pick your overlay — CODEX, CURSOR, COPILOT, WINDSURF, or GEMINI:
{ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteromallet/desloppify/main/docs/SKILL.md; printf '\n\n'; curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteromallet/desloppify/main/docs/<OVERLAY>.md; } >> AGENTS.md

If no overlay matches (Aider, opencode, Zed, Devin, and others):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteromallet/desloppify/main/docs/SKILL.md >> AGENTS.md
```

## From Vibe Coding to Vibe Engineering

Vibe coding gets things built fast. But the codebases it produces tend to rot in ways that are hard to see and harder to fix — not just the mechanical stuff like dead imports, but the structural kind. Abstractions that made sense at first stop making sense. Naming drifts. Error handling is done three different ways. The codebase works, but working in it gets worse over time.

LLMs are actually good at spotting this now, if you ask them the right questions. That's the core bet here — that an agent with the right framework can hold a codebase to a real standard, the kind that used to require a senior engineer paying close attention over months.

So we're trying to define what "good" looks like as a score that's actually worth optimizing. Not a lint score you game to 100 by suppressing warnings. Something where improving the number means the codebase genuinely got better. That's hard, and we're not done, but the anti-gaming stuff matters to us a lot — it's the difference between a useful signal and a vanity metric.

The hope is that anyone can use this to build something a seasoned engineer would look at and respect. That's the bar we're aiming for.

<summary><strong>Stuff you probably won't need to know</strong></summary>

#### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `scan [--reset-subjective]` | Run all detectors, update state (optional: reset subjective baseline to 0 first) |
| `status` | Score + per-tier progress |
| `show <pattern>` | Findings by file, directory, detector, or ID |
| `next [--tier N] [--explain]` | Highest-priority open finding (--explain: with score context) |
| `resolve <status> <patterns>` | Mark fixed / wontfix / false_positive / ignore |
| `fix <fixer> [--dry-run]` | Auto-fix mechanical issues |
| `review --prepare` | Generate subjective review packet (`query.json`) |
| `review --import <file>` | Import subjective review findings |
| `issues` | Review findings queue (list/show/update) |
| `zone` | Show/set/clear zone classifications |
| `config` | Show/set/unset project configuration |
| `move <src> <dst>` | Move file/directory, update all imports |
| `detect <name>` | Run a single detector raw |
| `plan` | Prioritized markdown plan |
| `tree` | Annotated codebase tree |
| `viz` | Interactive HTML treemap |
| `dev scaffold-lang` | Generate a standardized language plugin scaffold |

#### Detectors

**TypeScript/React**: logs, unused, exports, deprecated, large, complexity, gods, single_use, props, passthrough, concerns, deps, dupes, smells, coupling, patterns, naming, cycles, orphaned, react

**Python**: unused, large, complexity, gods, props, smells, dupes, deps, cycles, orphaned, single_use, naming

**C#/.NET**: deps, cycles, orphaned, dupes, large, complexity

#### Tiers & scoring

| Tier | Fix type | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| T1 | Auto-fixable | Unused imports, debug logs |
| T2 | Quick manual | Unused vars, dead exports |
| T3 | Needs judgment | Near-dupes, single_use abstractions |
| T4 | Major refactor | God components, mixed concerns |

Score is weighted (T4 = 4x T1). Strict score penalizes both open and wontfix.

#### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DESLOPPIFY_ROOT` | cwd | Project root |
| `DESLOPPIFY_SRC` | `src` | Source directory (TS alias resolution) |
| `--lang <name>` | auto-detected | Language selection (each has own state) |
| `--exclude <pattern>` | none | Path patterns to skip (repeatable: `--exclude migrations --exclude tests`) |
| `--no-badge` | false | Skip scorecard image generation |
| `--badge-path <path>` | `scorecard.png` | Output path for scorecard image |
| `DESLOPPIFY_NO_BADGE` | — | Set to `true` to disable badge via env |
| `DESLOPPIFY_BADGE_PATH` | `scorecard.png` | Badge output path via env |

Project config values (stored in `.desloppify/config.json`) are managed via:
- `desloppify config show`
- `desloppify config set target_strict_score 95` (default: `95`, valid range: `0-100`)
- `desloppify config set badge_path scorecard.png` (or nested path like `assets/health.png`)

#### Adding or augmenting a language

Use the scaffold workflow documented in `desloppify/languages/README.md`:

```bash
desloppify dev scaffold-lang <name> --extension .ext --marker <root-marker>
```

Detect command keys are standardized to snake_case. CLI compatibility aliases
like `single-use` and legacy `passthrough` are still accepted.
Standard plugin shape: `__init__.py`, `commands.py`, `extractors.py`, `phases.py`,
`move.py`, `review.py`, `test_coverage.py`, plus `detectors/`, `fixers/`, and `tests/`.
Validated at registration. Zero shared code changes.

#### Architecture

```
engine/detectors/            ← Generic algorithms (zero language knowledge)
hook_registry.py             ← Detector-safe access to optional language hooks
languages/_framework/runtime.py    ← LangRun (per-run mutable scan state)
languages/_framework/base/         ← Shared framework contracts + phase helpers
languages/_framework/generic.py    ← generic_lang() factory for tool-based plugins
languages/_framework/treesitter/   ← Tree-sitter integration (optional)
languages/<name>/            ← Language config + phases + extractors + detectors + fixers
```

Import direction: `languages/` → `engine/detectors/`. Never the reverse.
`LangConfig` stays static; runtime state lives on `LangRun`.

#### Command-Layer Boundaries

Command entry modules are intentionally thin orchestrators:

- `desloppify/app/commands/review/cmd.py` delegates to
  `desloppify/app/commands/review/prepare.py`, `desloppify/app/commands/review/batches.py`, `desloppify/app/commands/review/import_cmd.py`, and `desloppify/app/commands/review/runtime.py`
- `desloppify/app/commands/scan/scan_reporting_dimensions.py` delegates to
  `desloppify/app/commands/scan/scan_reporting_presentation.py` and `desloppify/app/commands/scan/scan_reporting_subjective.py`
- `desloppify/app/cli_support/parser.py` delegates subcommand construction to `desloppify/app/cli_support/parser_groups.py`

Public CLI behavior should be preserved when refactoring these orchestrators.

#### Allowed Dynamic Import Zones

Dynamic/optional loading is allowed only in explicit extension points:

- `desloppify/languages/__init__.py` for plugin discovery and registration
- `desloppify/hook_registry.py` for detector-safe optional hooks

Outside these zones, use static imports.

#### State Ownership

- `desloppify/state.py` and `desloppify/engine/_state/` own persisted schema and merge rules
- `desloppify/languages/_framework/runtime.py` (`LangRun`) owns per-run mutable execution state
- command modules may read/write state through state APIs, but should not define ad-hoc persisted fields
